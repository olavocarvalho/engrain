## Generic Adjectives to Replace

AI overuses vague, positive adjectives that add little meaning.

### The "Significant/Important" Family

| AI Adjective | Use Instead | Why |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| **Significant** | Meaningful, substantial, major, important | Often just filler |
| **Important** | Crucial, key, essential, vital (or delete) | Most overused adjective in AI text |

| **Productive** | Useful, helpful, fruitful | Be specific about output |

## Transitional Phrases: Formal vs Natural

AI overuses formal transitional phrases that make text feel stiff and academic.

### Additive Transitions (Connecting Ideas)

| Formal (Avoid Overuse) | Natural Alternative | When to Use |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Moreover** | And, also, plus, in addition | Formal academic only |
| **Furthermore** | And, also, besides | Formal academic only |
| **In addition** | Also, plus, and | Almost always "and" or "also" |
| **Additionally** | Also, plus, and | Almost always "and" or "also" |
| **Likewise** | Similarly, too, and | Informal: "too" |
| **Similarly** | In the same way, likewise | "In the same way" is more natural |

### Consecutive/Result Transitions (Showing Outcomes)

| Formal (Avoid Overuse) | Natural Alternative | When to Use |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Consequently** | So, therefore, as a result | "So" for most contexts |
| **Therefore** | So, thus, that's why | "So" for casual, "thus" for formal |
| **Thus** | So, therefore, that's why | Technical/formal OK |
| **Hence** | So, therefore, that's why | Very formal—avoid in casual |
| **As a result** | So, that's why | Natural in most contexts |

### Summative Transitions (Concluding)

| Formal (Avoid Overuse) | Natural Alternative | When to Use |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **In summary** | Overall, basically, to sum up | "Overall" is most natural |
| **In conclusion** | Overall, in the end, finally | "Overall" is most natural |
| **To summarize** | Basically, in short | "Basically" for casual |
| **Overall** | (This one is OK) | Generally natural |

### Introductory Phrases (The "Important to Note" Family)

**Always delete or significantly revise:**

| AI Phrase | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| "It's important to note that..." | Delete entirely |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Delete entirely |
| "It's important to remember that..." | Delete or "Remember that..." |
| "It's important to consider that..." | Delete or "Consider this:" |
| "It should be noted that..." | Delete entirely |
| "It is crucial to note that..." | Delete entirely |

**Why:** These are filler phrases that add no meaning. If something is important, state it directly without prefacing.

## Context-Specific Vocabulary

### Business/Professional Writing

**Avoid in business contexts:**
- leverage, orchestrate, synergize, incentivize, optimize
- robust, seamless, scalable, impactful
- facilitate, streamline, enhance

**Use instead:**
- leverage → use, apply
- orchestrate → coordinate, manage
- synergize → combine, work together
- incentivize → encourage, motivate
- optimize → improve
- robust → strong, reliable
- seamless → smooth, easy
- scalable → grows well, handles growth
- impactful → effective, powerful
- facilitate → help, assist, enable
- streamline → simplify
- enhance → improve, upgrade

### Technical Writing

**Acceptable in technical contexts:**
- robust (for systems that handle failure well)
- scalable (for systems that handle growth)
- optimize (for performance improvements)
- facilitate (for making processes easier)

**Still avoid:**
- delve, tapestry, symphony, realm
- orchestrate, leverage (unless leveraging assets in finance)
- comprehensive (use "complete" or specific scope)

### Academic Writing

**Acceptable in moderation:**
- Moreover, furthermore (1-2x per paper max)
- Consequently, therefore (when showing logical consequences)
- Elucidate, underscore (in true scholarly contexts)
- Meticulous, thorough (when describing methodology)

**Still avoid:**
- tapestry, symphony, realm (never appropriate)
- delve (use "examine" or "investigate")
- holistic (use "complete" or "comprehensive")
- impressive, impressively (show, don't tell)

### Creative Writing

**Avoid all AI words** in creative writing. Creative writing should have unique, original vocabulary. If you're using words like "delve" and "tapestry" in fiction or creative nonfiction, they'll stand out as inauthentic.

**Guideline:** If you wouldn't say it in conversation, don't write it in creative content.

## Notes

1. **Context matters:** Some AI words are legitimate in specific contexts (technical, academic). Use judgment.
2. **Moderation is key:** Using one or two "AI words" isn't fatal; overuse is the problem.
3. **Natural language test:** Would you say this in conversation? If not, reconsider.
4. **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying something is "impressive," show why it's impressive.
5. **Specific over vague:** Replace generic adjectives with specific, concrete language.

**Remember:** The goal isn't to avoid every word on this list. The goal is to write naturally, using words you'd actually use in conversation or authentic professional communication. If you're unsure, choose the simpler alternative.
