# Quick Start: 10-Minute AI Content Audit

A rapid workflow to review any piece of content for AI-generated patterns and fix issues quickly.

---

## The 10-Minute AI Audit

Use this step-by-step workflow to scan and improve any piece of content in 10 minutes or less.

### Minute 1: The Red Flag Scan (1 minute)

**What to do:** Search for top AI vocabulary red flags.

**Search for these terms:**
- delve, tapestry, symphony, realm
- comprehensive, holistic, nuanced
- moreover, furthermore, consequently
- "important to note," "worth noting"

**If found:**
- Count occurrences
- Replace with simpler alternatives
- See [VOCABULARY.md](VOCABULARY.md) for replacement options

**Quick replacements:**
| AI Word | Quick Fix |
|--------|-----------|
| delve | examine, explore |
| tapestry | mix, combination |
| symphony | combination, blend |
| realm | area, field |
| comprehensive | full, complete |
| holistic | full, complete |
| moreover/ furthermore | remove or use "and" |
| important to note | delete entirely |

---

### Minute 2-3: The Transition Audit (2 minutes)

**What to do:** Identify and fix overused formal transitions.

**Search for:** moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally, consequently, therefore, thus, hence

**Assessment:**
- 0-2 occurrences: Probably fine
- 3-5 occurrences: Streamline some
- 6+ occurrences: Remove or replace most

**Fix strategy:**
1. **Delete unnecessary transitions** (most are unnecessary)
2. **Replace with simple connectors** (and, but, so)
3. **Use paragraph breaks** to separate ideas instead
4. **Let ideas speak for themselves** without explicit connectors

**Example fix:**
```
Before: "The system is scalable. Furthermore, it is user-friendly. Additionally, it is cost-effective."
After: "The system is scalable, user-friendly, and cost-effective."
```

---

### Minute 4-5: The Sentence Variety Check (2 minutes)

**What to do:** Assess and improve sentence variety (burstiness).

**Quick assessment:**
1. **Count words in 10 consecutive sentences**
2. **Check if similar length** (within 3-4 words of each other)
3. **Look at sentence starts**—do they follow patterns?

**If sentences are uniform:**
- **Rewrite every 3rd sentence** to be dramatically different in length
- **Add 2-3 short, punchy sentences** (3-5 words)
- **Combine 2-3 sentences** into one flowing, complex sentence
- **Start sentences differently** (prepositions, verbs, adverbs)

**Quick fixes:**
- Add a fragment: "For emphasis. Like this."
- Combine: "The data shows X. It also shows Y." → "The data shows X and Y, with notable implications for..."
- Vary starts: Instead of "The..." "The..." "The..." try "However..." "Meanwhile..." "When..."

### Minute 6-7: The Personality Injection (2 minutes)

**What to do:** Add authentic human elements that AI cannot replicate.

**Add at least one of these:**
1. **A specific example** from your experience or knowledge
2. **A personal opinion** stated confidently
3. **An emotional reaction** or observation
4. **A conversational phrase** you'd actually say
5. **A concrete detail** (specific number, name, date)

**Examples:**
```
Generic: "The course provides comprehensive instruction."
Personal: "After taking this course, I finally understood why my projects kept failing."
```

```
Generic: "The results were significant."
Specific: "Response times dropped from 3.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds—a 700% improvement."
```

---

### Minute 8-9: The Formatting Check (2 minutes)

**What to do:** Ensure formatting isn't overly rigid or structured.

**Look for:**
- **Bullet point overuse** (more than 2-3 lists in short content)
- **Identical paragraph structure** (every paragraph: topic → support → summary)
- **Template-like organization** (highly predictable sections)

**Quick fixes:**
- **Convert some bullets to flowing prose**
- **Break up with subheadings, quotes, or highlighted text**
- **Vary paragraph lengths** (mix 1-sentence and 5-sentence paragraphs)
- **Add a narrative section** that flows without rigid structure

---

### Minute 10: The Read-Through Test (1 minute)

**What to do:** Read your content aloud and listen for problems.

**What to listen for:**
- **Stiff or awkward phrasing** → Smooth it out
- **Sentences that drag on** → Break them up
- **Robotic or monotone rhythm** → Add variety
- **Words you'd never actually say** → Replace with natural language

**Final question:** Would you believe a human wrote this without being told?

**If yes:** You're done.

**If no:** Identify what feels off and apply one more quick fix from above.

## Find & Replace Toolkit

Use these search-and-replace patterns for quick fixes.

### High-Impact Replacements

| Search For | Replace With | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| delve into | examine | #1 AI word - always replace |
| tapestry of | combination of | Rarely used by humans |
| symphony of | combination of | Pretentious in normal writing |
| underscore | highlight, show | Overused academic word |
| meticulous | careful, thorough | Suspiciously common |
| comprehensive | full, complete | Often unnecessary |
| holistic | full, complete | Buzzword red flag |
| leverage | use, apply | Corporate speak |
| harness | use, employ | Unnecessary grandiosity |
| orchestrate | coordinate, manage | Pretentious |
| foster | encourage, support | Overused |
| elevate | improve, raise | Fancy word for simple concept |
| Moreover, | [delete] or And | Formal transition |
| Furthermore, | [delete] or Also | Formal transition |
| Consequently, | So, Therefore | Formal transition |
| It's important to note that | [delete] | Filler phrase |
| It's worth noting that | [delete] | Filler phrase |

### Multi-Word Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "It is important to" | Delete or "Crucial to" |
| "It is worth noting" | Delete entirely |
| "In order to" | Replace with "to" |
| "Due to the fact that" | Replace with "because" |
| "In the event that" | Replace with "if" |
| "With regard to" | Replace with "about" |
| "In terms of" | Delete or rephrase |

## Red Flag Detector

The most suspicious patterns that immediately signal AI-generated content.

### Immediate Red Flags (Fix These First)

1. **"Delve"** - The #1 AI giveaway word
2. **"Tapestry"** - Almost never used by humans in normal writing
3. **"Symphony of [X]"** - AI loves this metaphor; humans rarely use it
4. **"Comprehensive tapestry"** - Double red flag
5. **"Holistic approach"** - Major buzzword indicator
6. **"Meticulous attention"** - Suspiciously formal
7. **3+ formal transitions per paragraph** - Structural red flag
8. **All sentences same length** - Low burstiness indicator
9. **"It's important to note"** - Classic AI hedge
10. **"Leverage [X] to [Y]"** - Corporate speak overuse

### Secondary Red Flags (Fix If Time)

- Generic adjectives: significant, important, effective, essential
- Action verbs: harness, unleash, unlock, orchestrate, foster
- Perfect grammar with no contractions
- No personal examples or opinions
- Heavy bullet point use
- Identical paragraph structure
- Overuse of "however" and "therefore"

### Context-Dependent (Use Judgment)

- Formal transitions in academic writing (acceptable in moderation)
- Technical vocabulary in technical content (appropriate)
- Professional tone in business communications (context-dependent)

## Common Findings & Solutions

### "I found 10+ AI words"

**Solution:** You may be over-relying on AI assistance or imitating AI patterns. Focus on:
- Writing in your own voice from scratch
- Using simpler, more direct language
- Reading human-written examples in your field
- Practicing writing without AI assistance

### "My sentences are all similar length"

**Solution:** Deliberately rewrite every 3rd sentence to be very different (much shorter or longer). Add fragments for emphasis. Combine short sentences into flowing, complex ones.

### "I have no personal examples to add"

**Solution:** You don't need personal experience. You can add:
- Specific numbers or statistics
- Concrete details about the subject
- A clear opinion or judgment
- An analogy or metaphor from your knowledge
- A "what if" scenario

### "I'm writing for a formal audience"

**Solution:** Professional ≠ robotic. The most respected formal writing is simple, clear, and direct—never pretentious. Use formal language when appropriate, but avoid words you'd never say in conversation.

### "My content was flagged as AI but I wrote it myself"

**Solution:** AI detectors are imperfect. However, you can add more distinctive human elements:
- More specific examples and details
- Stronger opinions expressed confidently
- More sentence variety and fragments
- Personal anecdotes or cultural references
- Domain-specific knowledge or jargon used correctly
